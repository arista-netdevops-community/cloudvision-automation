## About the tools used in this repository

- **cURL** is a command-line tool for getting or sending data using URLs
- **Wget** is a program that retrieves content from web servers
- **Postman** can be used to explore and test REST APIs and gRPC services
- **Python** with the following modules:
  - The **requests** library can be used for making HTTP requests in Python
  - The **cvprac** python library can be used to manage CVP. cvprac is written using CVP REST APIs an CVP resource APIs
  - The **pyGNMI** library is a gNMI client
- **gNMIc** is a command-line gNMI client
- **gnmi** is a command-line gNMI client
- **pygnmicli** is a command-line gNMI client
- **pyang** can be used to generate a tree representation of YANG models for quick visualization
- **gRPCurl** is a command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It's basically curl for gRPC servers  

## Requirements

CVP APIs require [token based authentication](Token%20based%20authentication).  

[RESTCONF](RESTCONF) and [gNMI](gNMI) require:

- To configure the devices to stream OpenConfig data to CVP.
- Configuring the devices to stream OpenConfig data to CVP requires to use certificate based authentication (for EOS and CVP communication).
  
So [RESTCONF](RESTCONF) and [gNMI](gNMI) require:

- [Certificate based authentication](Certificate%20based%20authentication/) (for devices and CVP communication)
- [YANG](YANG)
- [OpenConfig](OpenConfig)
- [Token based authentication](Token%20based%20authentication) (required for all CVP APIs)

## CVP version

All examples in this repository have been tested with CVP version 2022.1.0.
